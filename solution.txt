Question 1

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity, readability, and versatility. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991.

Key Features of Python
Readability and Simplicity: Python's syntax is clear and concise, making it easy to learn and use. This helps developers to write logical code and reduces the cost of program maintenance.

# Example of Python's readable syntax
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")
Interpreted Language: Python is an interpreted language, meaning that code is executed line by line, which simplifies debugging and allows for rapid development.

# You can run Python code interactively
>>> print("Hello, World!")
Hello, World!
Dynamically Typed: Python does not require explicit declaration of variable types, allowing for more flexibility.

# Dynamic typing example
x = 10
x = "Hello, World!"  # No error, type changes dynamically
Comprehensive Standard Library: Python comes with a rich standard library that supports many common programming tasks such as file I/O, system calls, and internet protocols.

# Using the standard library to read a file
with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
Extensive Ecosystem: Python has a vast ecosystem of third-party packages and frameworks for web development, data analysis, machine learning, and more.

# Using a third-party package (requests) to fetch a web page
import requests

response = requests.get('https://api.github.com')
print(response.json())
Community Support: Python has a large and active community that contributes to a wealth of resources, tutorials, and libraries.

Use Cases Where Python is Particularly Effective
Web Development: Python, with frameworks like Django and Flask, is widely used for building scalable and secure web applications.

# Flask example
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return "Hello, Flask!"

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
Data Science and Machine Learning: Python is the language of choice for data scientists due to libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and frameworks like TensorFlow and scikit-learn.

# Data analysis with Pandas
import pandas as pd

data = {'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'], 'Age': [25, 30, 35]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print(df)
Scripting and Automation: Python is excellent for writing scripts to automate repetitive tasks.

# Example script to rename multiple files
import os

for filename in os.listdir('.'):
    if filename.endswith('.txt'):
        os.rename(filename, filename.replace('.txt', '.md'))

Question 2
Steps to Install Python on Windows 10
1. Download Python Installer
Visit the official Python website: python.org.
Navigate to the "Downloads" section.
Click on the "Download Python 3.x.x" button. Make sure to download the latest version.
2. Run the Python Installer
Locate the downloaded installer file (usually in your "Downloads" folder) and double-click it to run.
In the installer window, check the box that says "Add Python to PATH". This will allow you to use Python from the command line.
Click on "Customize installation" if you want to modify the default installation settings. Otherwise, you can proceed with "Install Now".
Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.
3. Verify the Installation
Open the Command Prompt by pressing typing cmd, and hitting Enter.

In the Command Prompt, type the following command and press Enter:

python --version
You should see the Python version printed, indicating that Python is installed correctly.

Python 3.x.x
4. Install pip (Python Package Installer)
pip is included automatically with Python installation from version 3.4 onwards. You can verify if pip is installed by running:

pip --version
If pip is not installed, you can download get-pip.py from here and run:

python get-pip.py
5. Set Up a Virtual Environment
Navigate to your project directory:

cd path\to\your\project
Create a virtual environment:

python -m venv venv_name
Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows:
venv_name\Scripts\activate
Your command prompt should now indicate that the virtual environment is active (you'll see the name of the virtual environment in parentheses).

To deactivate the virtual environment, simply run:
deactivate
Example Commands for Setting Up a Virtual Environment
Navigate to project directory:
cd C:\Users\YourUsername\YourProject
Create virtual environment:
python -m venv myenv
Activate virtual environment:
myenv\Scripts\activate
Verify pip is working within the virtual environment:
pip --version
Install a package (e.g., requests) within the virtual environment:

pip install requests
Deactivate the virtual environment:
deactivate

Python Syntax and Semantics
Here's a simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console:

print("Hello, World!")
Explanation:
print: This is a built-in function in Python used to output text to the console.
"Hello, World!": This is a string literal, enclosed in double quotes, that represents the text to be printed.

Data Types and Variables
Python has several basic data types:

Integer (int): Whole numbers.
Float (float): Numbers with decimal points.
String (str): Text data.
Boolean (bool): Represents True or False.
List (list): Ordered collection of items.
Dictionary (dict): Collection of key-value pairs.

Here's a short script demonstrating the use of these data types:

# Integer
age = 25
print("Age:", age)

# Float
height = 5.9
print("Height:", height)

# String
name = "Alice"
print("Name:", name)

# Boolean
is_student = True
print("Is student:", is_student)

# List
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print("Numbers:", numbers)

# Dictionary
person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25, "is_student": True}
print("Person:", person)

Control Structures
Conditional Statements
Conditional statements allow you to execute code based on certain conditions. Here's an example of an if-else statement:

age = 18

if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")
else:
    print("You are a minor.")

Loops
Loops allow you to execute a block of code multiple times. Here's an example of a for loop:

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

for number in numbers:
    print(number)

Functions in Python
Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task. They help in organizing and reusing code.

Here's a Python function that takes two arguments and returns their sum:

def add(a, b):
    return a + b

# Example of calling the function
result = add(3, 5)
print("Sum:", result)

Lists and Dictionaries
Lists
Lists are ordered collections of items that can be of different types. You can access items by their index.

Dictionaries
Dictionaries are collections of key-value pairs. Keys are unique, and values can be of any type.

Here's a script demonstrating basic operations on lists and dictionaries:

# List
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
numbers.append(6)
print("List:", numbers)

# Dictionary
person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}
person["is_student"] = True
print("Dictionary:", person)

Exception Handling
Exception handling in Python allows you to handle errors gracefully using try, except, and finally blocks.

try:
    result = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot divide by zero.")
finally:
    print("This block always executes.")

Modules and Packages
Modules are files containing Python code (functions, classes, variables) that can be imported and used in other scripts. Packages are collections of modules.

To import and use a module, you use the import statement. Here's an example using the math module:

import math

# Using the sqrt function from the math module
result = math.sqrt(16)
print("Square root of 16:", result)
File I/O
Reading from a File

with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()
    print("File content:", content)
Writing to a File

lines = ["First line", "Second line", "Third line"]

with open('output.txt', 'w') as file:
    for line in lines:
        file.write(line + "\n")
